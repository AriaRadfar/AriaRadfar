__1️⃣A mad moment of passion, few seconds of ''percieved neuro-endocrine bliss'' & a lifetime of guilt, anguish, agony & regrets.__
Only a fool would enter such a bargain! 

2️⃣Redirect your energy to gutters or manifest it into something which is much more rewarding in the long run! 
You pick now! You can''t tread both ways as there'''s only one vehicle. Get in the driving seat of life and drive yourself to glory. 

3️⃣__There is noone as stupid as a man who repeatedly keeps doing ''self-harm'' with full knowledge of its after effects__.
A wise man always keeps the end result in foresight! 

4️⃣Don''t you realise how miserable and self-obsessed you become after you fap and differences when you don''t at all?
What more evidence do you need that fapping is lowering your consciousness and instead of expanding, it is being restricted?
Think over it, make amends and live life to the fullest. 

5️⃣Superconscious energy OR Droop to lowest living hells. 
YOLO & You only pick one for this life. 
Every act matters and makes a difference. 
Reflect, time for introspection. 

6️⃣__The richer one gets, the more protection it is required to safeguard the riches earned/accumulated.
You can''t afford to let your house get robbed every second day or week, can u? __
Don''t ever let urges catch you off guard! 
Never let your guard down, even in your sleep -> Cleanse subconscious by daily meditation which is a must to go longer in this journey. Aim to train your conscious and your subconscious watchman would be on night duty to help you.  

7️⃣Indulgence in any act/habit that takes us far from our life goals MUST be DELETED out of life immediately. 
Develop a habit of self evaluation. 
Live each day as if it were your last, youth doesn''t last forever. 
Now you don''t want to be fapping lifeforce out of you on your last day, would you? 
No self deception here.

8️⃣Instead of taking a step towards your potential best, you are resorting to PMO as soon as you find yourself alone.
It is sickening to see how much your mind has led you astray. 
Make mind your slave not the other way around. 

9️⃣**If the flesh is weak & the spirit is unwilling, where lies the remedy? **
Your willpower-willingness to change determines how far you''d go on this journey because there are no shortcuts. You can''t cheat your mind with external blockers for long, it sees it all what you''re doing.

🔟Act smarter from hereon to go farther and bring that change based on understanding and and from within!

__1️⃣A mad moment of passion, few seconds of ''percieved neuro-endocrine bliss'' & a lifetime of guilt, anguish, agony & regrets.__
Only a fool would enter such a bargain! 

2️⃣Redirect your energy to gutters or manifest it into something which is much more rewarding in the long run! 
You pick now! You can''t tread both ways as there'''s only one vehicle. Get in the driving seat of life and drive yourself to glory. 

3️⃣__There is noone as stupid as a man who repeatedly keeps doing ''self-harm'' with full knowledge of its after effects__.
A wise man always keeps the end result in foresight! 

4️⃣Don''t you realise how miserable and self-obsessed you become after you fap and differences when you don''t at all?
What more evidence do you need that fapping is lowering your consciousness and instead of expanding, it is being restricted?
Think over it, make amends and live life to the fullest.

هر سوال جمله یا واکنشی ک شمارو وارد چالش کنه

.اولین موقعیت وقتی طرف صرفا ب پیام شما واکنش نشون‌میده (لایک میکنه)ولی تمایلیی ب ادامه گفتگو نداره فعلا(حضوری میشه وقتی اپنر را اجرا کردی مستقیم گفتی شما خیلی خوشگلی گفته ممنون ویا در اولین پیام ها هستید

  .مقام دوم مقام جذب اولیه: وقتی که طرف پیوسته داره با شما دیگه صحبت میکنه و حرف میزنه

.مقام سوم جذب‌ : وقتیکه دختر باشما اومده بیرون و قرار تون خوب و موفقیت آمیز بوده
( در هر مقام دست شما باز تر می شود)

اپنرهای گستاخی و ریسکی:

 دوسپسرم... میگفت‌یدونه ،منم گفتم ی دوسدخترم دارم کاندوم رو میگف یدونه۰

سه حالت طرح شیک تست از طرف دختر هست'' 
.یکی حالت شوخی خنده
. یکی حالت چالش که می خواهد شما را وارد چالش بکنه 
.یکی حالت این که می خواهد شما را بکوبه
( در هر کدام باید یه مدل جواب داد)

واکنش های غلط ب شیت تیست:
ما چند دسته واکنش غلط به شیت تستها داریم

۱.انتخواب اشتباه  نوع پاسخ (نسبت ب مرحله آشنایی و نوع دختر یعنی پاسخی ک در مقام جذب باید بدی رو بیای در مقامهای اولیه بیاری
یا شیت تست شوخ طبعی زده شما جدی بگی
یا اومده جدی صحبت کرده شما تیکه دار ج بدی)

شیت تستهای حال بهم زن و چندش بازی: هرگونه جوابی ک دختر بگه ای

.سبک بازی،هرگونه چیزی ک بلوغ و مردانگی رو زیر سوال ببره 

.تیکه بی مزه :بگه سنت کمتره بگی مهم‌عقله

.جاش نیس و هنوز اتفاقی نیفتاده : بگه هدف همه پسرا یکیه،بگی حالا ی دادن ک این حرفارو نداره

.پاسخ همجنس گرایانه :بگه من هنوز اعتماد ندارم بگی لزبینی مگه؟ 

.بازی با کلمات سطحی: میگه من بدست آوردی نیسم تلاش نکن،میگی ب پا آوردنی هستی؟

. وعده یا ارجاع توخالی: میگه فرق تو با بقیه  پسرا چیه من اعتماد ندارم ،میگی من با همه پسرا فرق دارم، میگه خب بگو ببینم فرقت چیه ،میگی من حالا یه چرتی گفتم  تو جدی نگیر

واکنش غلط اینه ک جوابای کلیشه ای میگن،تکراریه براش
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون ،بگه ما که همو نمی شناسیم بگی خب بیا آشنا شیم

.القاع حس خفن و شاخ بودن ب طرف مقابله
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون، بگه نه، بگی پس معلومه هنوز نتونستم جذبت کنم

.شعر بی هدف و معنی پروندن

.پیچوندن تابلو، بگه فرقت چیه،بگی ولش کن و بحثو عوض کنی

.شوخی با اینکه تو عشقمی، میخوام مختو بزنم و ... در مقام جذب اولیه
در مقام جذب اولیه ازین شوخیا نکن

دسته دوم واکنشهای غلط واکنشهایی ک منطقی جواب بدی:

(اولین مرحله اینه ک قبول کنی باید مرحله ب مرحله پیش بری) 

.عقب نشینی از درخواست:بگه نمیام بیرون ،بگی خب حداقل جوابمو بده
یا میشه باهم دوست شیم بگی باشه
یک گام رو ب عقب،نشان دهنده بی اعتماد بنفسیه

.جواب منطقی:بگه اعتماد ندارم و بگی تو انسانی و نیاز داری و .......
بگه دوست معمولی باشیم ،بگی بعد ی مدت انسان ... و نمیشه دوست معمولی موند و..

.جدی شدن : برای جواب شیت تست عصبانی وجدی بشی

.ب تاقض کشیدن دختر: مثلا اوایل ب شما گفته من با پسر غریبه دوست نمیشم حالا همه کاری کردی باهاش بعد مثلا بگی بیا بیرون بگه من با پسر غریبه بیرون نمیام  بگی بروبابا اولش همه همینو میگن

.مستقیم گفتن اینکه من نمیخوامت کی گفته من میخوامت ،وقتی هنوز فرایند جذب اتفاق نیفتاده
مثلا میگه برا بدست آوردن من باید خیییلی تلاش باید بکنی و برو و...بگی کی گفته من تورو میخوام سلیغم نیسی و.. میگه توام سلیغم نیسی

.جوابهای کلیشه ای

اعتراض ب بد اخلاقی سردی بی ادبی و بی جنبگی طرف مقابل ولو ب شوخی
خب بابا حالا توام دیگه ... حالا بد اخلاق نباش و...

.پرسیدن سوال در حوضه شخصی و احساسات شخصی در شیت تست
مثلا من قصد رابطه نداری ،بگی در روابط گذشتت شکست خوردی نه ،بگو و توصیح بده بم

.توضیح خود
من اعتماد ندارمو بگی من کیم و چیم و تحقیق کن و میتونی عابرومو ببری و کجا کار میکنم و اخلاقم اینجوریه و اونجوریه و با دوست دخترم اینجوری بوده پس من قابل اعتمادم','None','جلسه ۹

واکنش های غلط ب شیت تیست:
ما چند دسته واکنش غلط به شیت تستها داریم

۱.انتخواب اشتباه  نوع پاسخ (نسبت ب مرحله آشنایی و نوع دختر یعنی پاسخی ک در مقام جذب باید بدی رو بیای در مقامهای اولیه بیاری
یا شیت تست شوخ طبعی زده شما جدی بگی
یا اومده جدی صحبت کرده شما تیکه دار ج بدی)

شیت تستهای حال بهم زن و چندش بازی: هرگونه جوابی ک دختر بگه ای

.سبک بازی،هرگونه چیزی ک بلوغ و مردانگی رو زیر سوال ببره 

.تیکه بی مزه :بگه سنت کمتره بگی مهم‌عقله

.جاش نیس و هنوز اتفاقی نیفتاده : بگه هدف همه پسرا یکیه،بگی حالا ی دادن ک این حرفارو نداره

.پاسخ همجنس گرایانه :بگه من هنوز اعتماد ندارم بگی لزبینی مگه؟ 

.بازی با کلمات سطحی: میگه من بدست آوردی نیسم تلاش نکن،میگی ب پا آوردنی هستی؟

. وعده یا ارجاع توخالی: میگه فرق تو با بقیه  پسرا چیه من اعتماد ندارم ،میگی من با همه پسرا فرق دارم، میگه خب بگو ببینم فرقت چیه ،میگی من حالا یه چرتی گفتم  تو جدی نگیر

واکنش غلط اینه ک جوابای کلیشه ای میگن،تکراریه براش
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون ،بگه ما که همو نمی شناسیم بگی خب بیا آشنا شیم

.القاع حس خفن و شاخ بودن ب طرف مقابله

.شعر بی هدف و معنی پروندن

.جواب منطقی:بگه اعتماد ندارم و بگی تو انسانی و نیاز داری و .......
بگه دوست معمولی باشیم ،بگی بعد ی مدت انسان ... و نمیشه دوست معمولی موند و..

.جدی شدن : برای جواب شیت تست عصبانی وجدی بشی

.ب تاقض کشیدن دختر: مثلا اوایل ب شما گفته من با پسر غریبه دوست نمیشم حالا همه کاری کردی باهاش بعد مثلا بگی بیا بیرون بگه من با پسر غریبه بیرون نمیام  بگی بروبابا اولش همه همینو میگن

.مستقیم گفتن اینکه من نمیخوامت کی گفته من میخوامت ،وقتی هنوز فرایند جذب اتفاق نیفتاده
مثلا میگه برا بدست آوردن من باید خیییلی تلاش باید بکنی و برو و...بگی کی گفته من تورو میخوام سلیغم نیسی و.. میگه توام سلیغم نیسی

#شیت تست
هر سوال جمله یا واکنشی ک شمارو وارد چالش کنه

.اولین موقعیت وقتی طرف صرفا ب پیام شما واکنش نشون‌میده (لایک میکنه)ولی تمایلیی ب ادامه گفتگو نداره فعلا(حضوری میشه وقتی اپنر را اجرا کردی مستقیم گفتی شما خیلی خوشگلی گفته ممنون ویا در اولین پیام ها هستید

  .مقام دوم مقام جذب اولیه: وقتی که طرف پیوسته داره با شما دیگه صحبت میکنه و حرف میزنه

.مقام سوم جذب‌ : وقتیکه دختر باشما اومده بیرون و قرار تون خوب و موفقیت آمیز بوده
( در هر مقام دست شما باز تر می شود)

اپنرهای گستاخی و ریسکی:

 دوسپسرم... میگفت‌یدونه ،منم گفتم ی دوسدخترم دارم کاندوم رو میگف یدونه۰

سه حالت طرح شیک تست از طرف دختر هست' 
.یکی حالت شوخی خنده
. یکی حالت چالش که می خواهد شما را وارد چالش بکنه 
.یکی حالت این که می خواهد شما را بکوبه
( در هر کدام باید یه مدل جواب داد)

واکنش های غلط ب شیت تیست:
ما چند دسته واکنش غلط به شیت تستها داریم

۱.انتخواب اشتباه  نوع پاسخ (نسبت ب مرحله آشنایی و نوع دختر یعنی پاسخی ک در مقام جذب باید بدی رو بیای در مقامهای اولیه بیاری
یا شیت تست شوخ طبعی زده شما جدی بگی
یا اومده جدی صحبت کرده شما تیکه دار ج بدی)

شیت تستهای حال بهم زن و چندش بازی: هرگونه جوابی ک دختر بگه ای

.سبک بازی،هرگونه چیزی ک بلوغ و مردانگی رو زیر سوال ببره 

.تیکه بی مزه :بگه سنت کمتره بگی مهم‌عقله

.جاش نیس و هنوز اتفاقی نیفتاده : بگه هدف همه پسرا یکیه،بگی حالا ی دادن ک این حرفارو نداره

.پاسخ همجنس گرایانه :بگه من هنوز اعتماد ندارم بگی لزبینی مگه؟ 

.بازی با کلمات سطحی: میگه من بدست آوردی نیسم تلاش نکن،میگی ب پا آوردنی هستی؟

. وعده یا ارجاع توخالی: میگه فرق تو با بقیه  پسرا چیه من اعتماد ندارم ،میگی من با همه پسرا فرق دارم، میگه خب بگو ببینم فرقت چیه ،میگی من حالا یه چرتی گفتم  تو جدی نگیر

واکنش غلط اینه ک جوابای کلیشه ای میگن،تکراریه براش
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون ،بگه ما که همو نمی شناسیم بگی خب بیا آشنا شیم

.یکی حالت شوخی خنده
. یکی حالت چالش که می خواهد شما را وارد چالش بکنه

#شیت تست
هر سوال جمله یا واکنشی ک شمارو وارد چالش کنه

.اولین موقعیت وقتی طرف صرفا ب پیام شما واکنش نشون‌میده (لایک میکنه)ولی تمایلیی ب ادامه گفتگو نداره فعلا(حضوری میشه وقتی اپنر را اجرا کردی مستقیم گفتی شما خیلی خوشگلی گفته ممنون ویا در اولین پیام ها هستید

  .مقام دوم مقام جذب اولیه: وقتی که طرف پیوسته داره با شما دیگه صحبت میکنه و حرف میزنه

.مقام سوم جذب‌ : وقتیکه دختر باشما اومده بیرون و قرار تون خوب و موفقیت آمیز بوده
( در هر مقام دست شما باز تر می شود)

اپنرهای گستاخی و ریسکی:

 دوسپسرم... میگفت‌یدونه ،منم گفتم ی دوسدخترم دارم کاندوم رو میگف یدونه۰

سه حالت طرح شیک تست از طرف دختر هست'' 
.یکی حالت شوخی خنده
. یکی حالت چالش که می خواهد شما را وارد چالش بکنه 
.یکی حالت این که می خواهد شما را بکوبه
( در هر کدام باید یه مدل جواب داد)

واکنش های غلط ب شیت تیست:
ما چند دسته واکنش غلط به شیت تستها داریم

۱.انتخواب اشتباه  نوع پاسخ (نسبت ب مرحله آشنایی و نوع دختر یعنی پاسخی ک در مقام جذب باید بدی رو بیای در مقامهای اولیه بیاری
یا شیت تست شوخ طبعی زده شما جدی بگی
یا اومده جدی صحبت کرده شما تیکه دار ج بدی)

شیت تستهای حال بهم زن و چندش بازی: هرگونه جوابی ک دختر بگه ای

.سبک بازی،هرگونه چیزی ک بلوغ و مردانگی رو زیر سوال ببره 

.تیکه بی مزه :بگه سنت کمتره بگی مهم‌عقله

.جاش نیس و هنوز اتفاقی نیفتاده : بگه هدف همه پسرا یکیه،بگی حالا ی دادن ک این حرفارو نداره

.پاسخ همجنس گرایانه :بگه من هنوز اعتماد ندارم بگی لزبینی مگه؟ 

.بازی با کلمات سطحی: میگه من بدست آوردی نیسم تلاش نکن،میگی ب پا آوردنی هستی؟

. وعده یا ارجاع توخالی: میگه فرق تو با بقیه  پسرا چیه من اعتماد ندارم ،میگی من با همه پسرا فرق دارم، میگه خب بگو ببینم فرقت چیه ،میگی من حالا یه چرتی گفتم  تو جدی نگیر

واکنش غلط اینه ک جوابای کلیشه ای میگن،تکراریه براش
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون ،بگه ما که همو نمی شناسیم بگی خب بیا آشنا شیم

.القاع حس خفن و شاخ بودن ب طرف مقابله
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون، بگه نه، بگی پس معلومه هنوز نتونستم جذبت کنم

.شعر بی هدف و معنی پروندن

.پیچوندن تابلو، بگه فرقت چیه،بگی ولش کن و بحثو عوض کنی

.شوخی با اینکه تو عشقمی، میخوام مختو بزنم و ... در مقام جذب اولیه
در مقام جذب اولیه ازین شوخیا نکن

دسته دوم واکنشهای غلط واکنشهایی ک منطقی جواب بدی:

(اولین مرحله اینه ک قبول کنی باید مرحله ب مرحله پیش بری) 

.عقب نشینی از درخواست:بگه نمیام بیرون ،بگی خب حداقل جوابمو بده
یا میشه باهم دوست شیم بگی باشه
یک گام رو ب عقب،نشان دهنده بی اعتماد بنفسیه

.جواب منطقی:بگه اعتماد ندارم و بگی تو انسانی و نیاز داری و .......
بگه دوست معمولی باشیم ،بگی بعد ی مدت انسان ... و نمیشه دوست معمولی موند و..

.جدی شدن : برای جواب شیت تست عصبانی وجدی بشی

.ب تاقض کشیدن دختر: مثلا اوایل ب شما گفته من با پسر غریبه دوست نمیشم حالا همه کاری کردی باهاش بعد مثلا بگی بیا بیرون بگه من با پسر غریبه بیرون نمیام  بگی بروبابا اولش همه همینو میگن

.مستقیم گفتن اینکه من نمیخوامت کی گفته من میخوامت ،وقتی هنوز فرایند جذب اتفاق نیفتاده
مثلا میگه برا بدست آوردن من باید خیییلی تلاش باید بکنی و برو و...بگی کی گفته من تورو میخوام سلیغم نیسی و.. میگه توام سلیغم نیسی

.جوابهای کلیشه ای

اعتراض ب بد اخلاقی سردی بی ادبی و بی جنبگی طرف مقابل ولو ب شوخی
خب بابا حالا توام دیگه ... حالا بد اخلاق نباش و...

.پرسیدن سوال در حوضه شخصی و احساسات شخصی در شیت تست
مثلا من قصد رابطه نداری ،بگی در روابط گذشتت شکست خوردی نه ،بگو و توصیح بده بم

.توضیح خود
من اعتماد ندارمو بگی من کیم و چیم و تحقیق کن و میتونی عابرومو ببری و کجا کار میکنم و اخلاقم اینجوریه و اونجوریه و با دوست دخترم اینجوری بوده پس من قابل اعتمادم','None','جلسه ۹

  .مقام دوم مقام جذب اولیه: وقتی که طرف پیوسته داره با شما دیگه صحبت میکنه و حرف میزنه

.مقام سوم جذب‌ : وقتیکه دختر باشما اومده بیرون و قرار تون خوب و موفقیت آمیز بوده
( در هر مقام دست شما باز تر می شود)

اپنرهای گستاخی و ریسکی:

 دوسپسرم... میگفت‌یدونه ،منم گفتم ی دوسدخترم دارم کاندوم رو میگف یدونه۰

سه حالت طرح شیک تست از طرف دختر هست'' 
.یکی حالت شوخی خنده
. یکی حالت چالش که می خواهد شما را وارد چالش بکنه 
.یکی حالت این که می خواهد شما را بکوبه
( در هر کدام باید یه مدل جواب داد)

واکنش های غلط ب شیت تیست:
ما چند دسته واکنش غلط به شیت تستها داریم

۱.انتخواب اشتباه  نوع پاسخ (نسبت ب مرحله آشنایی و نوع دختر یعنی پاسخی ک در مقام جذب باید بدی رو بیای در مقامهای اولیه بیاری
یا شیت تست شوخ طبعی زده شما جدی بگی
یا اومده جدی صحبت کرده شما تیکه دار ج بدی)

شیت تستهای حال بهم زن و چندش بازی: هرگونه جوابی ک دختر بگه ای

.سبک بازی،هرگونه چیزی ک بلوغ و مردانگی رو زیر سوال ببره 

.تیکه بی مزه :بگه سنت کمتره بگی مهم‌عقله

.جاش نیس و هنوز اتفاقی نیفتاده : بگه هدف همه پسرا یکیه،بگی حالا ی دادن ک این حرفارو نداره

.پاسخ همجنس گرایانه :بگه من هنوز اعتماد ندارم بگی لزبینی مگه؟ 

.بازی با کلمات سطحی: میگه من بدست آوردی نیسم تلاش نکن،میگی ب پا آوردنی هستی؟

. وعده یا ارجاع توخالی: میگه فرق تو با بقیه  پسرا چیه من اعتماد ندارم ،میگی من با همه پسرا فرق دارم، میگه خب بگو ببینم فرقت چیه ،میگی من حالا یه چرتی گفتم  تو جدی نگیر

واکنش غلط اینه ک جوابای کلیشه ای میگن،تکراریه براش
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون ،بگه ما که همو نمی شناسیم بگی خب بیا آشنا شیم

.القاع حس خفن و شاخ بودن ب طرف مقابله
مثلا میگی بیا بریم بیرون، بگه نه، بگی پس معلومه هنوز نتونستم جذبت کنم

.شعر بی هدف و معنی پروندن

.پیچوندن تابلو، بگه فرقت چیه،بگی ولش کن و بحثو عوض کنی

.شوخی با اینکه تو عشقمی، میخوام مختو بزنم و ... در مقام جذب اولیه

#شیت تست
هر سوال جمله یا واکنشی ک شمارو وارد چالش کنه

.اولین موقعیت وقتی طرف صرفا ب پیام شما واکنش نشون‌میده (لایک میکنه)ولی تمایلیی ب ادامه گفتگو نداره فعلا(حضوری میشه وقتی اپنر را اجرا کردی مستقیم گفتی شما خیلی خوشگلی گفته ممنون ویا در اولین پیام ها هستید

  .مقام دوم مقام جذب اولیه: وقتی که طرف پیوسته داره با شما دیگه صحبت میکنه و حرف میزنه

.مقام سوم جذب‌ : وقتیکه دختر باشما اومده بیرون و قرار تون خوب و موفقیت آمیز بوده
( در هر مقام دست شما باز تر می شود)

اپنرهای گستاخی و ریسکی:

 دوسپسرم... میگفت‌یدونه ،منم گفتم ی دوسدخترم دارم کاندوم رو میگف یدونه۰

سه حالت طرح شیک تست از طرف دختر هست' 
.یکی حالت شوخی خنده
. یکی حالت چالش که می خواهد شما را وارد چالش بکنه 
.یکی حالت این که می خواهد شما را بکوبه
( در هر کدام باید یه مدل جواب داد)

واکنش های غلط ب شیت تیست:
ما چند دسته واکنش غلط به شیت تستها داریم

۱.انتخواب اشتباه  نوع پاسخ (نسبت ب مرحله آشنایی و نوع دختر یعنی پاسخی ک در مقام جذب باید بدی رو بیای در مقامهای اولیه بیاری
یا شیت تست شوخ طبعی زده شما جدی بگی
یا اومده جدی صحبت کرده شما تیکه دار ج بدی)

شیت تستهای حال بهم زن و چندش بازی: هرگونه جوابی ک دختر بگه ای

.سبک بازی،هرگونه چیزی ک بلوغ و مردانگی رو زیر سوال ببره 

.تیکه بی مزه :بگه سنت کمتره بگی مهم‌عقله

.جاش نیس و هنوز اتفاقی نیفتاده : بگه هدف همه پسرا یکیه،بگی حالا ی دادن ک این حرفارو نداره

.پاسخ همجنس گرایانه :بگه من هنوز اعتماد ندارم بگی لزبینی مگه؟ 

.بازی با کلمات سطحی: میگه من بدست آوردی نیسم تلاش نکن،میگی ب پا آوردنی هستی؟

. وعده یا ارجاع توخالی: میگه فرق تو با بقیه  پسرا چیه من اعتماد ندارم ،میگی من با همه پسرا فرق دارم، میگه خب بگو ببینم فرقت چیه ،میگی من حالا یه چرتی گفتم  تو جدی نگیر
